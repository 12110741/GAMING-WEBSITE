   <p><h2><center> <P style="color: blue">Those old subway tracks are littered with gold, but it will
     take plenty of guts and fast feet for you to nab it for yourself.
      In Subway Surfers online, it’s up to Jake and his sprinting band of buddies to get down to the tracks,
       outpace that grumpy security guard and grab the gold without being smacked by a subway car.
        Fly down the tracks and don’t stop, because this browser game waits for no one! That’s right, 
        we said browser. As one of the most downloaded games around, Subway Surfers is enjoyed by people all over the globe.
         Now, you can keep pattering across the pavement from the comfort of your browser! First-time surfer? No worries,
          because this unblocked Subway Surfers game is easy and fun to learn, but tough to master.
           Let’s break down the gameplay. </center> </h2></P>

           <p><h2><center> <P style="color: blue">At the start of every free Subway Surfers online game, 
            you find yourself hoofing your way down the tracks with that lumbering inspector breathing right down your neck.
             If you stop for even one second, he’s going to snatch you up by the collar, 
             so it’s full speed ahead no matter what, got it? As you sprint and surf down the subway,
              you will dash left and right across three lanes to avoid obstacles. 
              You’ll soon find that the subway surface is littered with all kinds of stuff that you have to dash around, 
              duck under or jump over. Your biggest concern, of course, is the subway cars that are barreling right towards you! 
              That’s right, you’re running against traffic. What, you didn’t think the whole subway would stop
               just so you could grab some gold, did you? Speaking of gold, you’re not down there just to have fun risking your neck.
                You’re grabbing as many gold coins as you can. Dash side to side, surf with your hoverboard, and do whatever else you
                 have to do to get the loot without going splat! And that was your Kiloo.com introduction to the web-version of Subway
                  Surfers.<img src=" https://www.kiloo.com/assets/img/subway_media/jake.png"</center> </h2></p>

                  <P><H2><center><p style="color: blue;">Of course, there’s a lot more to being a Subway Surfer than just running 
                    down the same track and grabbing coins. This game has so many downloads,
                     it has its own community! Thousands of surfers take to the tracks every month, so to keep things interesting,
                      the Subway Surf game crew created rotating special characters, promos, and our personal favorite, the World Tour.
                      
                      What’s the World Tour, you ask? Every few weeks, the Subway Surfers crew heads to another location around the world. 
    At each tour stop, there’s a character unique to that area who can give you a tour of the tracks. 
     You’ll soon see that the subway cars, obstacles and scenery around you are totally different. Awesome,
      right? This allows the Subway Surfers game community a chance to keep things exciting and show their surfing
          skills off to the whole world. You won’t be able to shove off much, though, if you don’t master a few things first.
       Let’s take a look.</p></center></H2></P>

        <P><H2><center><p style="color: blue;"> Sure, you’re young, quick and full of nerve,
             but that doesn’t mean you won’t bounce off the back of a subway train like the rest of 
            us! If you’re going to grab more than just a few coins with each run, 
       you will definitely want to know what you’re up against first. Alright, so let’s talk Subway Surfers game obstacles.
        We’ll start from the ground up. See those striped construction signs? They’re sturdier than they look.
        You can jump over the short ones and roll under the tall ones. As usual, 
        a quick dash to the side will also do the trick, so long as you have the space for it. 
           Next, you’ve got shrubs and bushes. There’s no rolling under these firmly planted obstacles – you have to jump!
       The same goes for high ledges and bridges, which you’ll need to jump onto. Last but not least are the vehicles.
         Some of the subway cars are coming right at you, and some of them are parked. Unless you’re on a surfboard, 
         you will certainly not win in a head-on 
      collision! <img src=" https://www.kiloo.com/assets/img/subway_media/award.png"</center></H2></P>

               <P><H2><center><p style="color: blue;">We’re so excited to bring you the browser Subway Surfers runner game
               that we would like to give you some words of wisdom to help you reach that pro skill level faster. 
                First and foremost, learn how to quickly come down from a power jump. Sometimes,
               you realize in midair that you’re about to smack into a high obstacle, so you need to land quickly.
               By pressing down, you can come rocketing back to the ground and even roll under a high 
              obstacle immediately after landing. It’s a super important skill, so make sure you master it! Also,
               don’t forget that you can control Jake’s (and all the other characters) movement in the air. If you need 
               to dash to another lane while in midair, you can! Finally, make sure you are always looking as
                  far ahead as you can. The farther you can see, the more time you will have to react to what’s coming.
               These are all great Subway Surfers internet games tips for just staying alive, but what about Word Hunt,
               High Scores, consumables and objectives? If you like cool gear and your name on a High Score list, you won’t

                      hard-to-reach areas, so make sure you’re ready for a daring maneuver ahead of time. This feature is called 
                      “Word Hunt.” Each day, the letters spell out a different word. If you can grab them all, you’ll get some awesome 
                      loot! For every consecutive day that you complete the Word Hunt, the prizes will be even better.
                       Between clambering for letters and jacking up that high score, you’re sure to have plenty 
                       to do in this Subway Surfers online game. Even so, we always want to make sure that the best games on Kiloo.

                   Each level has a different shaped grid filled with candies of two to six different colours
                    (Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Orange, and Green) and sometimes obstacles (more known as blockers). 
                    The basic move of the game consists of swapping two candies positions to align sets of three of the same colour, 
                    whereupon they disappear, causing candies above them to collapse into the space left behind, often resulting in chain reactions. 
                    Moves and alignments must be horizontal/vertical. The level's objectives must be met before the player runs out of moves
                     (or time on timed levels); in each case, the player must earn enough points to get the first star
                      (out of 3) in the scoring system.

                    <P><H2><center><p style="color:blue">Temple Run is a 3D endless running video game developed and published by Imangi Studios. The player controls an explorer who has obtained an ancient relic and runs from demonic monkey-like creatures chasing him. The game was initially released for iOS devices on August 4, 2011, and later ported to Android systems and Windows Phone 8.

                        The game was a commercial success with positive reviews from critics. The success of the game led to a sequel Temple Run 2. Collaborations with Disney/Pixar to create Temple Run: Brave and Temple Run: Oz, and a third spin-off in development by Scopely titled, Temple Run: Treasure Hunters as a match-three video game. Temple Run also received activity books and a board game, with Warner Bros. Studios talking with Imangi Studios of a possible film adaptation. The success of the game also inspired multiple games that copy Temple Run's gameplay and branding.

                    <P><H2><center><p style="color:blue">In Temple Run, the player controls either Guy Dangerous,
                       an average explorer, Scarlett Fox, an escape artist, Barry Bones, a city cop, Karma Lee,
                        the fastest runner in the Far East, Montana Smith, the "second greatest explorer ever" 
                        (referring to Indiana Jones being the greatest explorer), Francisco Montoya, a Spanish conquistador,
                         or Zack Wonder, a football star. The character chosen will embark on an adventure to
                          seek an ancient and valuable golden idol from an Aztec temple. They will not realize 
                          that the temple is inhabited by a family of demonic monkeys who wants to devour them.
                           As the game is an endless running game, there is no end to the temple; the player plays
                            until the character collides into a large obstacle, falls into the water, or is overtaken by the demon monkeys.

                        While the character is running, the player can swipe left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and/or avoid obstacles. There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running: gold, red, and blue. A gold coin will only add one coin to the player's total number of coins. Red coins are worth two coins, while blue coins are worth three. The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade power-ups and/or other characters. Coins can also be bought by the player through in-app purchases with payments of actual money. When the player needs to turn left or right, the touchscreen can be swiped in the corresponding direction. If the player wishes to jump over an object, the screen can be swiped upwards; if the player wishes to slide under an object, the screen can be swiped downwards.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Temple_Run_gameplay.png/210px-Temple_Run_gameplay.png"</p></center></H2></P>
